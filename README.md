### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

_The goal was to develope an app that uses a grid displayed database to hold information on items. The requirements were to have a means to signin/register accounts, a way to add, edit and delete items from the database, a way to have SMS notifications, and the display of all items within the database in a grid based list._

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

_Having all features within the main page allowed users to easily access the information or functions they wanted without having to go through multiple pages and potentialy get lost. Allows with that, the UI was design to be simple and easy to read/ navigate._

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

_During coding, I took one page at a time going from one to the next as a user would. Therefore, I would start with the signin/registration pages, then go to the main page, then to pages accessible from that page, etc. This was an effective way to ensure everything was implemented and every page was connected._

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

_I would test each aspect individualy using toast to ensure the proper result came, and then slowly add new elements and go through each aspect related to that new element. This process is important, because it allows you to find errors in the system and where those error are or could have taken place._

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

_The main challenged were within coding, because I am not fully confident in my ability to code in android studio, to ensure each visual element was connected to the right code. I would often need to lookup functions, and how certain function can be used together to get the result I was looking for._

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

_I feel like the overall design and implementation of the system was successful. I didn't feel like I complete messed something up. While I do feel like I could have dont some aspects better, I am content with what I acompoished baised on it being my first attempt at creating an application._
